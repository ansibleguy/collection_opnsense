As an initiator, the first non-range/non-subnet is used to initiate the connection to. As a responder the local destination address must match at least to one of the specified addresses, subnets or ranges.

Each name references a pool by name from either the pools section or an external pool. Note that the order in which they are queried primarily depends on the plugin order"
    "proposals","list","false","['default']","props","A proposal is a set of algorithms. For non-AEAD algorithms this includes IKE an encryption algorithm, an integrity algorithm, a pseudo random function (PRF) and a Diffie-Hellman key exchange group. For AEAD algorithms, instead of encryption and integrity algorithms a combined algorithm is used. With IKEv2 multiple algorithms of the same kind can be specified in a single proposal, from which one gets selected. For IKEv1 only one algorithm per kind is allowed per proposal, more algorithms get implicitly stripped. Use multiple proposals to offer different algorithm combinations with IKEv1. Algorithm keywords get separated using dashes. Multiple proposals may be separated by commas. The special value default adds a default proposal of supported algorithms considered safe and is usually a good choice for interoperability."
    "unique","string","false","no","\-","One of: 'no', 'never', 'keep', 'replace'; Connection uniqueness policy to enforce. To avoid multiple connections from the same user, a uniqueness policy can be enforced."
    "aggressive","boolean","false","false","aggr","Enables IKEv1 Aggressive Mode instead of IKEv1 Main Mode with Identity Protection. Aggressive Mode is considered less secure because the ID and HASH payloads are exchanged unprotected. This allows a passive attacker to snoop peer identities and even worse, start dictionary attacks on the Preshared Key"
    "version","string","false","ike","vers, v","One of: 'ike', 'ikev1', 'ikev2'; IKE major version to use for connection. 1 uses IKEv1 aka ISAKMP, 2 uses IKEv2. A connection using IKEv1+IKEv2 accepts both IKEv1 and IKEv2 as a responder and initiates the connection actively with IKEv2"
    "mobike","boolean","false","true","mob","Enables MOBIKE on IKEv2 connections. MOBIKE is enabled by default on IKEv2 connections and allows mobility of clients and multi-homing on servers by migrating active IPsec tunnels. Usually keeping MOBIKE enabled is unproblematic, as it is not used if the peer does not indicate support for it. However, due to the design of MOBIKE, IKEv2 always floats to UDP port 4500 starting from the second exchange. Some implementations donâ€™t like this behavior, hence it can be disabled"
    "encapsulation","boolean","false","false","udp_encapsulation, encap","To enforce UDP encapsulation of ESP packets, the IKE daemon can manipulate the NAT detection payloads. This makes the peer believe that a NAT situation exist on the transmission path, forcing it to encapsulate ESP packets in UDP. Usually this is not required but it can help to work around connectivity issues with too restrictive intermediary firewalls that block ESP packets"
    "reauth_seconds","integer","false","\-","reauth, reauth_sec, reauth_time","	Time to schedule IKE reauthentication. IKE reauthentication recreates the IKE/ISAKMP SA from scratch and re-evaluates the credentials. In asymmetric configurations (with EAP or configuration payloads) it might not be possible to actively reauthenticate as responder. The IKEv2 reauthentication lifetime negotiation can instruct the client to perform reauthentication. Reauthentication is disabled by default (0). Enabling it usually may lead to small connection interruptions as strongSwan uses a break-before-make policy with IKEv2 by default"
    "rekey_seconds","integer","false","\-","rekey, rekey_sec, rekey_time","IKE rekeying refreshes key material using a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, but does not re-check associated credentials. It is supported with IKEv2 only. IKEv1 performs a reauthentication procedure instead. With the default value, IKE rekeying is scheduled every 4 hours minus the configured rand_time. If a reauth_time is configured, rekey_time defaults to zero, disabling rekeying. In that case set rekey_time explicitly to both enforce rekeying and reauthentication"
    "over_seconds","integer","false","\-","over, over_sec, over_time","Hard IKE_SA lifetime if rekey/reauth does not complete, as time. To avoid having an IKE or ISAKMP connection kept alive if IKE reauthentication or rekeying fails perpetually, a maximum hard lifetime may be specified. If the IKE_SA fails to rekey or reauthenticate within the specified time, the IKE_SA gets closed. In contrast to CHILD_SA rekeying, over_time is relative in time to the rekey_time and reauth_time values, as it applies to both. The default is 10% of either rekey_time or reauth_time, whichever value is larger. [0.1 * max(rekey_time, reauth_time)]"
    "dpd_delay_seconds","integer","false","\-","dpd_delay, dpd_delay_sec, dpd_delay_time","Interval to check the liveness of a peer actively using IKEv2 INFORMATIONAL exchanges or IKEv1 R_U_THERE messages. Active DPD checking is only enforced if no IKE or ESP/AH packet has been received for the configured DPD delay. Defaults to 0s"
    "dpd_timeout_seconds","integer","false","\-","dpd_timeout, dpd_timeout_sec","Charon by default uses the normal retransmission mechanism and timeouts to check the liveness of a peer, as all messages are used for liveness checking. For compatibility reasons, with IKEv1 a custom interval may be specified. This option has no effect on IKEv2 connections"
    "send_certificate_request","boolean","false","true","send_cert_req","Send certificate request payloads to offer trusted root CA certificates to the peer. Certificate requests help the peer to choose an appropriate certificate/private key for authentication and are enabled by default. Disabling certificate requests can be useful if too many trusted root CA certificates are installed, as each certificate request increases the size of the initial IKE packets"
    "send_certificate","string","false","\-","send_cert","One of: '' (default), 'ifasked', 'never', 'always'; Send certificate payloads when using certificate authentication. With the default of [ifasked] the daemon sends certificate payloads only if certificate requests have been received. [never] disables sending of certificate payloads altogether whereas [always] causes certificate payloads to be sent unconditionally whenever certificate-based authentication is used"
    "keying_tries","integer","false","\-","keyingtries","Number of retransmission sequences to perform during initial connect. Instead of giving up initiation after the first retransmission sequence with the default value of 1, additional sequences may be started according to the configured value. A value of 0 initiates a new sequence until the connection establishes or fails with a permanent error"

    "close_action","string","false","none","close","One of: 'none', 'trap', 'start'; Action to perform after a CHILD_SA gets closed by the peer. The default of none does not take any action. trap installs a trap policy for the CHILD_SA (note that this is redundant if start_action includes trap). start tries to immediately re-create the CHILD_SA. close_action does not provide any guarantee that the CHILD_SA is kept alive.

Usage
*****

To apply changes to the keys, you need to set 'reload: true' on each call or use the :ref:`ansibleguy.opnsense.reload <modules_reload>` module to apply it once you finished modifying all entries!

As far as I can tell - the IPSec service gets restarted one you do so - be aware of that.

Vault
=====

You may want to use '**ansible-vault**' to **encrypt** your 'private_key' content!

.. code-block:: bash

    ansible-vault encrypt_string '-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n...-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n'

    # or encrypt the private_key file beforehand (might be easier)
    ansible-vault encrypt /path/to/private/key/file.pem
