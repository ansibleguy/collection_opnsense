Used for cache snooping and ideally should only be configured for your administrative host. **Deny Non-local**: Allow only authoritative local-data queries from hosts within the netblock defined below. Messages that are disallowed are dropped. **Refuse Non-local**: Allow only authoritative local-data queries from hosts within the netblock defined below. Sends a DNS rcode REFUSED error message back to the client for messages that are disallowed."
