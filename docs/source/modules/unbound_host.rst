Info
****

This module manages DNS host-overrides configuration that can be found in the WEB-UI menu: 'Services - Unbound DNS - Overrides - Host overrides'

Entries like these override individual results from the forwarders.

Use these for changing DNS results or for adding custom DNS records.

Keep in mind that all resource record types (i.e. A, AAAA, MX, etc. records) of a specified host below are being overwritten.

Usage
*****

First you will have to know about **host-matching**.

The module somehow needs to link the configured and existing host-overrides to manage them.

You can to set how this matching is done by setting the 'match_fields' parameter!

The default behaviour is that a host-override is matched by its 'hostname', 'domain', 'record_type', 'value' and 'prio' fields.

However - it is **recommended** to use/set 'description' as **unique identifier** if many overrides are used.
