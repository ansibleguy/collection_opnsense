Info
****

This module manages DNS domain-overrides configuration that can be found in the WEB-UI menu: 'Services - Unbound DNS - Overrides - Domain overrides'

Entries like these override an entire domain by specifying an authoritative DNS server to be queried for that domain.

Usage
*****

First you will have to know about **domain-matching**.

The module somehow needs to link the configured and existing domain-overrides to manage them.

You can to set how this matching is done by setting the 'match_fields' parameter!

The default behaviour is that a domain-override is matched by its 'domain' and 'server' fields.

However - it is **recommended** to use/set 'description' as **unique identifier** if many overrides are used.
